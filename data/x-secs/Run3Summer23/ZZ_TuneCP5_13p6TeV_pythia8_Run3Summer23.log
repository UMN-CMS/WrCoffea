Before Filter: total cross section = 1.285e+01 +- 6.564e-03 pb
Filter efficiency (taking into account weights)= (1e+06) / (1e+06) = 1.000e+00 +- 0.000e+00
Filter efficiency (event-level)= (1e+06) / (1e+06) = 1.000e+00 +- 0.000e+00    [TO BE USED IN MCM]

After filter: final cross section = 1.285e+01 +- 6.564e-03 pb
After filter: final fraction of events with negative weights = 0.000e+00 +- 0.000e+00
After filter: final equivalent lumi for 1M events (1/fb) = 7.782e+01 +- 8.738e-02
