# WrCoffea Documentation

Welcome to the WR analyzer! This repository contains tools for analyzing and processing WR background, data and signal events. Below, youâ€™ll find instructions on setting up the environment, running the analysis, and extending the framework.

## Table of Contents
- [Running the Analyzer](docs/run_analysis.md) â€“ How to execute `run_analysis.py` to perform the analysis.
- [Workflow Overview](docs/workflow.md) â€“ A detailed guide on the full data processing pipeline.
- [Plotting](docs/plotting.md) â€“ Instructions for generating plots from the histogram ROOT files.
- [Code Structure](README.md#-code-structure) â€“ Explanation of the repository organization.
- [Getting Started](README.md#getting-started) â€“ Instructions for installing and setting up the analyzer.

## ðŸ“‚ Repo Structure
This repository is structured to separate executable scripts, core analysis logic, and documentation.

```
bin/       # Contains the run_analysis.py script to execute the analysis.
docs/      # Documentation files
src/       # Contains main analyzer code
scripts/   # Helper scripts for pre- and post-processing
data/      # Input/output datasets
python/    # Reusable Python modules
test/      # Test and developmental scripts
```
---
## Getting Started
Begin by cloning the repository,
```bash
git clone git@github.com:UMN-CMS/WrCoffea.git
cd WrCoffea
```
Create and source a virtual python environment,
```bash
python3 -m venv wr-env
source wr-env/bin/activate
```
Install the appropriate packages,
```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Grid UI
To authenticate for accessing grid resources, use:
```bash
voms-proxy-init --rfc --voms cms -valid 192:00
```

### ROOT
To enable ROOT functionality, source the appropriate LCG release:
```bash
source /cvmfs/sft.cern.ch/lcg/views/LCG_106/x86_64-el9-gcc13-opt/setup.sh
```
If using UMNâ€™s setup, use:
```bash
source /cvmfs/sft.cern.ch/lcg/views/LCG_104/x86_64-centos8-gcc11-opt/setup.sh
```

## Extending the Analyzer
The files [bin/run_analysis.py](https://github.com/UMN-CMS/WrCoffea/blob/main/bin/run_analysis.py) and [src/analyzer.py](https://github.com/UMN-CMS/WrCoffea/blob/main/src/analyzer.py) define a standard event selection and histogramming process.

For independent studies with **custom variables, selections, or histograms**, develop your scripts in the [`test/`](https://github.com/UMN-CMS/WrCoffea/tree/main/test) folder.

### Adding a New Study
1. Copy an existing script from `test/`:
   ```bash
   cp src/analyzer.py test/dev_analyzer.py
   ```
2. Modify the script to include your custom selections and histograms.
3. Once finalized, integrate your study into the main pipeline via `bin/`, `python/`, or `src/`.
